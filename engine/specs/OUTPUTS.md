# Outputs

The simulation emits:

- notifications
- modal prompts
- cash-change events
- state-change events

## Notifications

Notifications are emitted at:

- notable event triggers
- some facility-state transitions

Route-failure notification behavior:

- a failed route request may emit a visible route-failure notification when the caller enables feedback
- repeated failures from the same source floor are suppressed by a per-source-floor cache until that cache is cleared
- new-game initialization clears that cache
- `rebuild_route_reachability_tables()` also clears that cache before rebuilding carrier/special-link reachability, so topology edits re-enable route-failure popups even within the same save/day
- the notification uses a shared timed on-screen message slot rather than a modal prompt

Exact UI presentation is implementation-defined. Timing relative to simulation state changes is not.

Notification IDs are logical popup codes loaded through the game's resource system.

Known visual popup / prompt IDs (bitmap / dialog resources):

- `0x2713`: bomb ransom prompt
- `0x2714`: bomb detonation result
- `0x2716`: fire-rescue prompt family
- `0x2718`: star-rating / Tower award popup
- `0x2719`: ongoing fire notification
- `0x271a`: VIP special-visitor activation popup
- `0x271e`: bomb/fire active-status reminder
- `0x271f`: bomb ransom paid result

The `0x568` / `0x569` / `0x5a8` / `0x628` / `0x629` / `0x668` / `0x6a8` / `0x6a9` / `0xb28` / `0x2712` / `0x271b` / `0x271c` / `0x271d` IDs are **wave resource IDs**, not visual popups — they are played through WAVMIX16 with no on-screen output. See [SOUND.md](SOUND.md).

Clean-room rule:

- model notifications by logical popup code, not by raw NE resource id
- preserve the event-to-popup mapping above when parity matters
- exact localized wording and pixel art are presentation data, not simulation state

## Prompts

Prompts pause the relevant gameplay flow until the player responds.

Blocking prompt families:

- bomb ransom
- fire response
- demolition confirmations when active traffic would be disrupted

Modal acknowledgement-only dialogs:

- bomb armed / search-start status (`0xbcd`, `0xbce`)
- bomb cleanup outcome (`0xbcf`, `0xbd0`)
- treasure payout dialog (`0xbe0`)

Non-simulation informational dialogs:

- selected-object / inspector dialogs (`0x2fb`, `0x2fc`); these are UI inspection dialogs, not simulation prompts

Clean-room prompt-response command surface:

- `bomb_ransom_decision`: pay or refuse
- `fire_rescue_decision`: dispatch helicopter or decline
- `carrier_edit_confirmation`: confirm or cancel the destructive carrier edit guarded by prompt `0x3ed`

Dialogs outside those three classes may still be modal in the original UI, but they do not
represent branching simulation decisions in the recovered game logic.

Headless rule:

- when a blocking prompt is emitted, the current tick finishes collecting outputs
- no later simulation tick should advance until a prompt-response command is applied
- prompt-response side effects apply first, then normal stepping may resume

## Tick Output Order

For one headless tick:

1. apply commands
2. update any immediate derived state required by those commands
3. run simulation work
4. collect cash changes
5. collect state changes
6. collect notifications
7. emit any new prompts
8. if a blocking prompt was emitted, stop further advancement until a response command is applied
