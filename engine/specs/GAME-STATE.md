# Game State And Progression

## Global Progression Fields

Maintain at least:

- `star_count`
- `weekend_flag`
- `facility_progress_override`
- metro-station presence and floor
- evaluation-site presence and floor
- recycling-adequate flag
- office-placed flag
- route-viable flag
- office-service-ok flag

## `weekend_flag`

`weekend_flag` alternates inside a 3-day cycle and affects:

- commercial capacity selection
- some hotel timing
- condo staggering
- some progression gates

## `facility_progress_override`

When active and the tower is below 5 stars, commercial venues use the more generous capacity tier normally reserved for the override state. This flag is periodically set and cleared by scheduler checkpoints.

## Metro Station

The simulation tracks whether a metro station has been placed. That state:

- enables metro-related display behavior
- gates 4-star to 5-star advancement
- affects some vertical-placement bounds

Note:

- progression and placement use the global metro floor/presence state
- the random VIP/special-visitor toggle uses the placed-object `special_visitor_flag` on metro-station types
- no simulation gate reads that field, so it is treated as display-only state

## Star Advancement

Star progression depends on both:

- sufficient total tower activity
- qualitative gate conditions

Exact qualitative gates by current star tier:

- `1 -> 2`: no additional gate once the activity threshold is met
- `2 -> 3`: a security office must have been placed
- `3 -> 4`: office placed, recycling adequate, office-service evaluation passed, route viability true, `daypart_index >= 4`, and `calendar_phase_flag == 0`
- `4 -> 5`: metro station placed, recycling adequate, route viability true, `daypart_index >= 4`, and `calendar_phase_flag == 0`

The Tower-grade promotion uses a separate cathedral/evaluation path rather than the normal star gate.

## Gate Meanings

- `route_viable`: exact binary behavior is narrower than the old wording implied
  - new game initialization clears it to `0`
  - start-of-day `rebuild_path_seed_bucket_table()` sets it to `1` whenever `star_count > 2`
  - the reviewed `reset_star_gate_state()` path resets the other star-gate flags but did not show a write to this flag
  - no later route-scoring helper was found writing a more selective predicate in the reviewed binary pass
  - practical parity consequence: after reaching 3 stars, the gate stays false until the next day-start rebuild, then latches true until a full gate initialization path clears it again
- `office-service-ok`: set by the office-service evaluation system (see below)

## Office Service Evaluation

This is the mechanism behind the 3→4 star gate's "office-service evaluation passed"
condition.

### State fields

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `office_service_ok` | 0 = not passed, 1 = passed. The 3→4 gate flag. |
| `eval_target_entity` | Identity of the office entity under evaluation. Null sentinel = none, cleared sentinel after resolution. |
| `eval_in_progress` | 0 = idle, 1 = evaluation in progress. |

The office-service fields are reset to their initial values at new game start and on each star advancement.

### Trigger

This is not a scheduler checkpoint. The trigger runs during normal office entity refresh (family 7). It only becomes eligible on evaluation days, while stale evaluation state is separately cleared at the tick 1600 checkpoint.

During that office-entity refresh path, when all of:
- `star_count == 3`
- `office_service_ok == 0` (not already passed)
- `eval_in_progress == 0`
- `day_counter % 9 == 3`

The system scans for an office entity in state 0x01 with an active service assignment.
On match: stores entity identity in `eval_target_entity`, sets `eval_in_progress = 1`,
fires notification 3000.

### Resolution

When the cathedral guest arrives at the target office,
`resolve_office_service_evaluation` fires:
1. Validates `eval_in_progress != 0` and entity matches `eval_target_entity`
2. Computes `compute_runtime_tile_average()` for the office
3. Compares against the current upper operational threshold global (`0xe5ec`)
   - this threshold is loaded by `refresh_operational_status_thresholds_for_star_rating()`
   - at the only eligible tier (`star_count == 3`), the threshold is `150`
4. If average ≤ threshold: **pass** → `office_service_ok = 1`, notification `0xBBA`
5. If average > threshold: **fail** → `office_service_ok = 0`, notification `0xBBB`
6. Clears `eval_in_progress = 0` and `eval_target_entity = cleared sentinel`

### Cleanup

At the tick 1600 checkpoint, the evaluation state is cleared if `day_counter % 9 != 3`, preventing stale state from
persisting across non-evaluation days.

If the target entity becomes invalid before resolution, the evaluation unconditionally fails and state is cleared.

## Simulation-Wide Persistent State

The top-level game state includes:

- time counters
- tower progression flags
- cash and ledgers
- placed objects
- runtime actors
- sidecar tables
- route/reachability caches
- event state
- pending outputs/prompts
